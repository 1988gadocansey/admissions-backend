                            The duration of the programme is 1 academic year. This programme is being run in collaboration with University of Education, Winneba, and the certificate will be awarded by (University of Education, Winneba)

                        <p>All payment of fees should be done with your admission number above.</p>




                        <p>1. Your admission is for <b>the {{ applicant.lettersettings.working_year }} Academic Year.</b> If you fail to enroll, or if

                            you withdraw from the programme without prior approval from the University,
                            you shall forfeit the admission automatically.
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <b>The {{ applicant.lettersettings.working_year }} Academic Year</b> is scheduled to begin on {{ applicant.lettersettings.reporting|date:"l jS F Y" }}.
                            You are therefore expected to report for medical examinations and registration from
                            <b>{{ applicant.lettersettings.medical_examinations_starts |date:"l jS F Y" }}</b> to <b>{{ applicant.lettersettings.medical_examinations_ends |date:"l jS F Y" }}.</b>
                            You are also mandated to participate in an orientation programme which shall run from

                            <b>{{ applicant.lettersettings.orientation_starts|date:"l jS F Y" }}</b> to <b>{{ applicant.lettersettings.orientation_ends |date:"l jS F Y" }}.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>3.
                            You are required to make a PAYMENT of <b>GH¢2666</b>, which include tuition and graduation fee and at any branch of <b>Consolidated Bank of Ghana</b> into <b>Account Number 0152000570361</b> with this admission number {{ applicant.application_number }}.
                            If you do not indicate acceptance of this admission by paying the fees before, your admission will be offered to another applicant on the waiting list.

                            You are to make a photocopy of the pay-in-slip for keeps and present the original to the University’s Directorate of Finance on your arrival on campus. Indicate your admission number and programme of study on the pay-in-slip. Any Applicant who fails to PAY the fees forfeits his/her admission. Note: Fee payment is for an Academic Year, and it is non-refundable.


                        </p>

                        <p>4.
                            You shall be on probation for the full duration of your programme, and you may be dismissed at any time for unsatisfactory academic work or misconduct.
                            You shall be required to adhere to ALL the rules and regulations of the University as contained in the University Statutes, the Examinations Policy, the Ethics Policy and the Students’ Handbook.


                        </p>





                        <p>5.
                            You are also to note that your admission is subject to your being declared
                            medically fit to pursue the programme of study in this University. <b>You are,
                                therefore, required to undergo medical examinations at the University Health
                                Centre before registration. You shall be withdrawn from the University if you
                                fail to undergo the medical examinations.</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>6.
                            Applicants shall also be held personally responsible for any false statement(s) or
                            omission(s) made in their applications.
                        </p>

                        <p>7.
                            The University does not give financial assistance to students. It is therefore the
                            responsibility of students to arrange for their own sponsorship and maintenance
                            during their period of study.
                        </p>

                        <p>8.
                            You are to note that the University is a secular institution; it is therefore not
                            bound by observance of any religious or sectarian practices. As much as possible,
                            the University lectures and/or examinations would be scheduled to take place
                            within normal working days, but, where it is not feasible, lectures and
                            examinations would be held on other days.
                        </p>

                        <p>10.
                            As a policy of the University, all students shall be required to register under the
                            National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) on their own to enable them access
                            medical care whilst on campus.
                        </p>




                        <p>11.
                                Any applicant who falsifies result(s) shall be withdrawn from the University
                                and shall forfeit his/her fees paid.
                            </p>




                        <p>
                            Accept my congratulations on your admission to the University.
